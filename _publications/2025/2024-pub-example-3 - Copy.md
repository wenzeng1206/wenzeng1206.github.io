  This study examines social influence in massively multiplayer online games, investigating how reciprocity impacts group emotion and, subsequently, group well-being. Guided by the theory of bounded generalized reciprocity and emotional contagion, we combine self-reported and behavioral data from Sky: Children of the Light players to test whether “Playtime Social Value” can serve as a proxy for perceived group well-being, offering an innovative measure of player influence. Findings are expected to provide insights for designing supportive gaming environments that enhance player retention and satisfaction.
