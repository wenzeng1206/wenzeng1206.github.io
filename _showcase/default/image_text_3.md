    <h5 class="card-title">Crime, Cost, and College Rankings: A Data-Driven Exploration of University Trade-offs in the U.S.</h5>
    <p class="card-text">
      This project investigates how U.S. university rankings relate to surrounding housing prices, tuition levels, and local crime rates. I constructed a comprehensive dataset by scraping university data, retrieving crime statistics from a public API, and integrating housing price data from Zillowâ€”merging all three using ZIP codes. Through data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory analysis in Python, I examined the correlations between institutional prestige and indicators of affordability and safety.

The project demonstrates my ability to build multi-source datasets, standardize complex variables, and draw meaningful insights using statistical analysis and data visualization. Beyond exploring patterns in university ecosystems, the work highlights broader questions about social inequality and accessibility in higher education, offering a practical tool for students and policymakers to evaluate the trade-offs between rank, cost, and safety.
