    <h5 class="card-title">AI-Driven Gaming Trend Intelligence for Strategic Communication</h5>
    <p class="card-text">
      As part of my graduate coursework in AI-Assisted Strategic Communication, I co-developed an AI-powered market intelligence system designed to help Griffin Gaming Partners, a leading gaming venture capital firm, detect real-time genre trends and audience sentiment. Leveraging YouTube’s public API, we collected metadata and user comments from nearly 3,000 gameplay videos and applied natural language processing tools including a custom-trained BERT model for genre classification and GPT-based sentiment analysis. The system outputs a dashboard that tracks rising or declining game genres and community emotional response—offering investors a dynamic tool for trend forecasting, content timing, and sentiment-aligned decision-making. This project showcases my ability to build scalable data pipelines, apply machine learning to real-world communication challenges, and translate behavioral signals into actionable strategic insights.
