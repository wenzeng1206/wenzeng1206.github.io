    <p class="card-text">
      This project is part of a broader research initiative on player influence dynamics in Sky: Children of the Light, sharing the same dataset and machine learning pipeline as my lead-author study, Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation in Mobile Massively Multiplayer Online Game: Player Influence Dynamics in Sky: Children of Light. While the main study focused on modeling overall behavioral predictors of social influence using the COM-B framework, this complementary project narrows in on gender-based behavioral differences.

Integrating Social Role Theory with COM-B, I analyzed how male and female players differ in their capabilities (e.g., in-game resource collection), opportunities (e.g., playtime, social engagement), and motivations (e.g., achievement vs. relationship-building), and how these factors contribute to their social valueâ€”an empirical measure of networked influence. The findings show that even in a gender-neutral environment, internalized norms persist: male players tended to gain more influence through task-based gameplay, while female players were more socially engaged but did not receive the same influence returns. This work offers new insights into how gender shapes player impact in cooperative digital spaces and suggests design strategies to foster more equitable recognition of diverse playstyles.
